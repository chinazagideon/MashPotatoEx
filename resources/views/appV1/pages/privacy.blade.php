                            with your name and email address and to designate a password. In order to participate in

                            require certain information to confirm your status as an accredited investor. For example,
                            Users hoping to participate in a token offering or trade cryptocurrency in an individual
                            capacity, and not on behalf of a corporation or trust, must provide their full name, social
                            security number, phone number, address, date of birth, and if such participation requires
                            the User to be an accredited investor, proof of required assets (such as an asset appraisal)
                            or income (such as tax filings or pay stubs), as well. More information regarding investor
                            accreditation is available <a href="https://support.coinlist.co/support/solutions/articles/67000521381-accreditation-faqs">here</a>. We may also require Users
                            to complete a short questionnaire regarding their interest in specific types of tokens and
                            cryptocurrencies.

                            personally identifiable information. Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but
                            not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect
                            your personal information.
